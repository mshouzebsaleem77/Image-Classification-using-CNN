Binary Classification
Binary classification is the task of classifying the elements of a set into two groups on the basis of a classification rule. I used simple Convolutional Neural Network and the accuracy i got is 81%. (You can improve this accuracy more than this)

The DataSet i used to solve this problem is simple Cat and Dog. (If you want to get a dataset then dm me on my email i will give you dataset that i used in my notebook).

## How to use
1. You can simply run my notebook.
2. I saved my model in firsttry.h5 file.
3. Simply put any image of cat or dog and check the results.
